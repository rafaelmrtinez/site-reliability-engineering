## Overview
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform used to run, scale, and manage containerized applications. It helps automate deployment, self-healing, scaling, and service discovery.

### Key terms
- **Node**: A machine that runs workloads. It can be physical or virtual.
- **Cluster**: A group of nodes working together.
- **Master Node**: Handles orchestration and control-plane functions.
- **API Server**: The front door for all Kubernetes communication.
- **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that keeps cluster state.
- **Scheduler**: Decides which node should run a workload.
- **Container Runtime**: Software that runs containers such as containerd or CRI-O.
- **Kubelet**: An agent running on each node that ensures containers are healthy.

**Summary**: Nodes run workloads, while the control plane manages the cluster and keeps it healthy.

```bash
# Basic kubectl checks
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A
```

## Containerd vs Docker
**Quick explanation**: Docker is a developer-focused tool, but Kubernetes typically uses a lower-level container runtime such as containerd.

- **Docker**: A container platform that includes the Docker Engine.
- **Containerd**: A lightweight runtime used to run containers efficiently.
- **Docker flow**: Docker Engine -> dockerd -> containerd -> runc

**Why it matters**: In Kubernetes, containerd is commonly used behind the scenes instead of Docker as the direct runtime.

```bash
# Containerd examples
ctr images ls
ctr images pull docker.io/library/nginx:latest
```

**Example flow**: A container image is pulled by the runtime, then the runtime starts the pod container on a selected node.

---

## Nerdctl
**Quick explanation**: Nerdctl is a tool that resembles Docker but is designed to work with containerd-compatible runtimes.

```bash
# Nerdctl examples
nerdctl images ls
nerdctl run --name myapp nginx
```

**Summary**: Nerdctl provides a Docker-like experience for containerd-based systems, especially in environments where Docker is not the primary runtime.

---

## Crictl
**Quick explanation**: Crictl is used to inspect and debug containers through the CRI-compatible runtime. It is not the main tool for creating workloads.

```bash
# Crictl examples
crictl ps -a
crictl images
crictl logs <container_id>
crictl exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh
```

**Summary**: Use crictl for troubleshooting and inspecting low-level runtime behavior.

---

## Pods
**Quick explanation**: A pod is the smallest unit in Kubernetes. It usually contains one container, but it can contain multiple containers when they are tightly related.

### Pod characteristics
- Smallest object in Kubernetes
- Usually one application per pod
- Can run on different nodes
- Has a one-to-one relationship with the main container
- Multiple containers in one pod are only used for tightly related helper processes

**Note**: Helper containers are rare and only used when one container depends on another in the same pod.

```yaml
# Pod example
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: frontend
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp-container
      image: nginx
```

```bash
# Create and inspect the pod
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod myapp-pod
```

**Summary**: Pods are the basic runtime unit; most workloads are then managed by higher-level objects such as ReplicaSet or Deployment.

---

## kubectl Basics
**Quick explanation**: kubectl is the main command-line tool used to interact with a Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
# Basic commands
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
kubectl get pods
kubectl cluster-info
```

**Summary**: These commands help you create a workload, list running resources, and confirm cluster connectivity.

---

## YAML Base Configuration in Kubernetes
**Quick explanation**: Kubernetes objects are commonly defined as YAML files. The YAML describes the object type, metadata, and the desired state of the workload.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: frontend
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp-container
      image: nginx
```

```bash
# Create and inspect the pod from YAML
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod myapp-pod
```

**Summary**: This example shows the same application pattern we will reuse in the ReplicaController, ReplicaSet, and Deployment examples.

---

## Replication Controller
**Quick explanation**: A ReplicationController ensures that a specific number of identical pod replicas are always running.

- High availability
- Restarts failed pods automatically
- Maintains a target number of replicas
- Older object, mostly replaced by ReplicaSet and Deployment

**Sample ReplicaController configuration**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: myapp-rc
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        type: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp-container
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

```bash
# Create and inspect the controller
kubectl create -f rc.yaml
kubectl get rc
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe rc myapp-rc
```

**Create, update, and delete**
```bash
# Create a controller from a YAML file
kubectl create -f rc.yaml

# Apply or update the controller definition
kubectl apply -f rc.yaml

# Increase or decrease replica count
kubectl scale rc myapp-rc --replicas=5

# Delete the controller and all managed pods
kubectl delete rc myapp-rc
```

**Summary**: The controller makes sure the cluster keeps the desired number of pod copies running even if some fail.

**Note**: A ReplicationController does not explicitly declare a selector in the manifest. Instead, it relies on the labels in the pod template to manage the matching pods.

---

## ReplicaSet
**Quick explanation**: A ReplicaSet is the modern replacement for ReplicationController. It ensures that a specific number of matching pods are running and uses a selector to determine which pods belong to it.

- More modern than ReplicationController
- Maintains desired replicas
- Uses selectors for matching pods
- Common building block for Deployment

**Sample ReplicaSet configuration**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: myapp-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        type: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp-container
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

```bash
# Create and inspect the ReplicaSet
kubectl create -f rs.yaml
kubectl get rs
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe rs myapp-rs
```

**Create, scale, update, and delete**
```bash
# Create a ReplicaSet from YAML
kubectl create -f rs.yaml

# Apply updates to the ReplicaSet definition
kubectl apply -f rs.yaml

# Scale to a specific replica count
kubectl scale rs myapp-rs --replicas=5

# Scale up from the current value to a higher count
kubectl scale rs myapp-rs --replicas=10

# Scale down to a smaller count
kubectl scale rs myapp-rs --replicas=2

# Update the replica count directly in the YAML and re-apply
kubectl apply -f rs.yaml

# Delete the ReplicaSet and its managed pods
kubectl delete rs myapp-rs
```

**Summary**: The selector is required in ReplicaSet because it tells Kubernetes which pods belong to this set and must be kept at the desired replica count.

**Note**: The selector must match the labels in the template. In this example, both use `type: frontend`.

---

## ReplicaController vs ReplicaSet
**Quick explanation**: Both objects maintain a desired number of pod replicas, but ReplicaSet is newer and more flexible.

### ReplicaController
- Older object
- Less flexible selector model
- Does not explicitly declare a selector in the manifest
- Works well for simple replication scenarios

### ReplicaSet
- Modern object
- Must define a selector
- Supports `matchLabels` and more robust matching logic
- Commonly used as the base for Deployment

**Example comparison**
```bash
# ReplicationController example
kubectl create -f rc.yaml
kubectl scale rc myapp-rc --replicas=3
kubectl delete rc myapp-rc

# ReplicaSet example
kubectl create -f rs.yaml
kubectl scale rs myapp-rs --replicas=3
kubectl delete rs myapp-rs
```

**Summary**: ReplicaSet is preferred over ReplicationController because it is a newer and more capable object.

**Note**: In real Kubernetes usage, Deployment is usually preferred over both because it adds rolling updates and rollback support.

---

## Deployment (Modern Recommendation)
**Quick explanation**: Deployment is the most common Kubernetes workload object used in production. It manages ReplicaSets behind the scenes and provides rolling updates, rollbacks, and easier version management.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp-container
          image: nginx
```

```bash
# Create and check deployment
kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get rs
kubectl get pods
kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deploy
```

**Summary**: A Deployment creates a ReplicaSet for you, then manages updates and scaling in a smoother way than working with the lower-level objects directly.

---

## Final Notes
**The lifecycle of a simple app**:
1. Create a pod definition.
2. Manage replicas with ReplicationController or ReplicaSet.
3. Use Deployment to manage updates and rollout safely.
4. Scale with `kubectl scale` or update YAML and apply it again.
5. Inspect with `kubectl get`, `kubectl describe`, and `kubectl logs`.

This structure keeps the same application example (`myapp`) throughout the notes, making it easier to understand how Kubernetes objects relate to each other.

**Recommended order to study**:
- Pods
- ReplicationController
- ReplicaSet
- Deployment
- kubectl troubleshooting commands

**Example workflow**
```bash
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
kubectl create -f rc.yaml
kubectl create -f rs.yaml
kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe deployment myapp-deploy
```

**Summary**: Kubernetes moves from basic pod creation to replicated workloads and finally to managed deployments for real-world application delivery.
